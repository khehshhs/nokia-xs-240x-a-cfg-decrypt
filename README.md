uh i used ai im not sure 100% if this is original and if there are any issues you are on your own.
anyways here are the steps.
make sure python is installed and download the "nokia.py" script somewhere
make sure cryptohome is installed "pip install pycryptodome"
then use this to decrypt the file "python nokia.py -u CFG NAME HERE.cfg"
you should recieve the file and you can check through the xml file with the text editor of your choice.
